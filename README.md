# ***IMPORTANT PLEASE READ***
_____________________________

***API Breaking Change***
`lcd_bus.RGBBus` and `lcd_bus.I80Bus` have had the data pins consilidated into a single parameter.
The parameter name is `data_pins` and it is a tuple of the pin numbers that needs to be passed.

`lcd_bus.RGBBus` had 2 parameters removed. The `disp` and `disp_active_high` parameters. The "disp" 
pin is the power pin and it should be set as such with the display driver and not the bus

----------------------------------------------

The `mpy_cross` build command has been removed. It will be compiled automatically if it has not been compiled yet.

The `submodules` build command has been removed. The build script takes care of this for you automatically.

The `clean` command has changed behavior. All ports are cleaned prior to a build using makefile's clean routine. 
There are occasions where something gets stuck and the clean is not completed. That is where this command comes in. This wil do a complete
wipe of the micropython build folders no matter what is in them. On the `unix` and `macos` ports using this command will remove 
the SDL2 compilation. the clean that gets performed prior to every build will not.



# LVGL binding for Micropython
______________________________

I have tried to make this as simple as possible for paople to use. 
There are some glitches still in it I am sure. If you come across an issue 
please let me know.

I am still in development mode for the unix port. I am writing an SDL driver 
that conforms To the rest of the driver framework. I have started working on 
writing the frameworks for the different indev (input) types that LVGL supports.
The frameworks are written to make it easier to write display and input drivers
for the binding.

### *New changes*
___________________________

ALL MCU's
I have started to nail down a commoin API for the indev drivers, specifically the pointer/touch drivers.
In order to do this I had to change the handling of the type of bus being used. Just like the displays the 
touch/pointer driver IC's can sometimes accept an SPI bus or an I2C bus as the way to communicate.
Instead of having to duplicate code for these driver IC's I decided to make the software driver completely
unaware of the bus that is being used. To do this i made the I2C driver work in the same manner as the SPI driver.

Here is a code example of how to use the I2C bus with a touch driver.

```py
from i2c import I2C
import ft5x06

i2c_bus = I2C.Bus(host=1, sda=10, sdl=11)
touch_i2c = I2C.Device(i2c_bus, ft5x06.I2C_ADDR, ft5x06.BITS)
touch = ft5x06.FT5x06(touch_i2c)
```

If a touch driver doesn't have the variable `I2C_ADDR` or `BITS` then that driver 
doesn't support the I2C bus.


ESP32-ALL
* `--optimize-size`: If you are having an issue with getting the firmware to fit into your esp32
  or if space is more of a concern than speed you can set this command line option. This will tell the compiler that the 
  firmware size is more important than performance and the compiled binary will be smaller as a result.  

* `--flash-size={size}`: Flash sizes that are able to be used are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 across all 
  variants of the ESP32. It is up to the user to know what their board is using.

* `--ota`: If you want to set the partitions so you can do an over the air update of 
  the firmware. I do want to note that this does take up twice as much application 
  storage space. This feature applies to any board.

* `CONFIG_*={value}`: You can alter the config settings of the esp-idf by using these settings. Refer to the ESP-IDF documentation
  for further information

* `SPI`: The `machine.SPI` class has undergone a HUGE change. It is now split into 2 pieces. `machine.SPI.Bus` and `machine.SPI.Device`
  They exactly what they seem. It is easier to show a code example then it is to explain it.
  
```py
from machine import SPI

spi_bus = SPI.Bus(
    host=1,
    mosi=15,
    miso=16,
    sck=10
)
      
spi_device = SPI.Device(
    spi_bus=spi_bus,
    freq=10000000,
    cs=3,
    polarity=0,
    phase=0,
    bits=8,
    first_bit=SPI.MSB
)
      
# if you want to delete a device from being used you have to deinit it first
# and then you can delete it
spi_device.deinit()
del spi_device
      
# if you want to stop using a bus and all devices attached to it
del spi_bus
del spi_device
      
# The SPI.Bus instance you need to pass to machine.SDCard, lcd_bus.SPIBus
# and any of the touch drivers that use SPI. 
```

All methods that existed for the original `machine.SPI` are available in 
the `machine.SPI.Device` class. They work exactly how they did before.

## *Build Instructions*
_______________________

I have changed the design of the binding so it is no longer a dependancy of 
MicroPython. Instead MicroPython is now a dependency of the binding. By doing 
this I have simplified the process up updating the MicroPython version. Only 
small changes are now needed to support newer versions of MicroPython.

In order to make this all work I have written a Python script that handles
Building the binding. The only prerequesits are that you have a C compiler 
installed (gcc, clang, msvc) and the necessary support libs.

### *Build Target*
__________________

You are also going to need Python >= 3.10 installed for all builds

There is a single entry point for all builds. That is the make.py script in the
root of the repository.

The first argument is positional and it must be one of the following.

  * esp32
  * windows
  * macOS
  * stm32
  * unix
  * rp2 
  * renesas-ra
  * nrf
  * mimxrt
  * samd


<br>

### *Build Options*
________________________

The next few arguments are optional to some degree.

  * submodules\*\*: collects all needed dependencies to perform the build.  Usually not needed because it is automatic.
  * clean: cleans the build environment.  Often unnecessary.
  * mpy_cross\*\*: compiles mpy-cross 
               this is not used for all builds. if it is not supported it will do nothing.  In most cases it is automatic.

**must be run only one time when the build is intially started. after that you will not need 
to add these arguments. There is internal checking that is done to see if the argument needs to 
be carried out. So you can also optionally leave it there if you want. 

<br>

### *Identifying the MCU board*
_______________________________

The next group of options are going to be port specific, some may have them and some may not.

  * BOARD: The MCU to build for. This follows the same symantics as what MIcroPython uses.
  * BOARD_VARIANT: if there is a variation of the board that it to be compiled for.


I will go into specifics for what what boards and variants are available for a specific port a 
little bit further down.

<br>

### *Additional Arguments*
____________________

  * LV_CFLAGS: additional compiler flags that get passed to the LVGL build only.
  * FROZEN_MANIFEST: path to a custom frozen manifest file
  * DISPLAY: this can either be the file name (less the .py) of a display 
             driver that is in the driver/display folder or it can be the absolute
             path to your own custom driver (with the .py extension)
  * INDEV: this can either be the file name (less the .py) of an indev 
           driver that is in the driver/indev folder or it can be the absolute
           path to your own custom driver (with the .py extension)


<br>

### *ESP32 specific options*
____________________________
  * --skip-partition-resize: do not resize the firmware partition
  * --partition-size: set a custom firmware partition size
  * --octal-flash ¹: This is only available for the 16mb flash and the 32mb flash
  * --flash-size ² ³: This is how much flash storage is available.

    Allowed Values are:

    * ESP32-S3: 4, 8, 16 and 32 (default is 8)
    * ESP32-S2: 2 and 4 (default is 4)
    * ESP32: 4, 8 and 16 (default is 4)
    , The default is 8.
  

¹ Available for the ESP32-S3 when `BOARD_VARIANT` is set to `SPIRAM_OCT`<br> 
² Available for the ESP32, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3<br>
³ Available only when `BOARD_VARIANT` is set to `SPIRAM` or `SPIRAM_OCT`<br>

## *Build Command Examples*
___________________________

Build for an ESP32-S3 processor with Octal SPIRAM and the given display and input drivers

    python3 make.py esp32 BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=SPIRAM_OCT DISPLAY=st7796 INDEV=gt911

If you have problems on builds after the first one, you can try adding the "clean" keyword to clear out residue from previous builds.

I will provide directions on how to use the driver framework and also the drivers that are included
with the binding in the coming weeks.

<br>

SDL fpr Unix is working properly. Make sure you review the requirements needed to compile for unix!!!
The build system compiles the latest version of SDL2 so the list is pretty long for the requirements.

To build for Unix use the following build command

    python3 make.py unix DISPLAY=sdl_display INDEV=sdl_pointer


Couple of notes:

  * **DO NOT** enable LV_USE_DRAW_SDL, I have not written code to allow for it's use (yet).
  * I recommend running `lv.task_handler` once every 5 milliseconds, shorter than that and you 
    will have a lot of CPU time comsumed. Longer than that and your mouse response is not 
    going to be great.



Here is some example code for the unix port
```py
from micropython import const  # NOQA

_WIDTH = const(480)
_HEIGHT = const(320)

_BUFFER_SIZE = _WIDTH * _HEIGHT * 3

import lcd_bus  # NOQA

bus = lcd_bus.SDLBus(flags=0)

buf1 = bus.allocate_framebuffer(_BUFFER_SIZE, 0)

import lvgl as lv  # NOQA
import sdl_display  # NOQA

lv.init()

display = sdl_display.SDLDisplay(
    data_bus=bus,
    display_width=_WIDTH,
    display_height=_HEIGHT,
    frame_buffer1=buf1,
    color_space=lv.COLOR_FORMAT.RGB888
)
display.init()

import sdl_pointer

mouse = sdl_pointer.SDLPointer()

scrn = lv.screen_active()
scrn.set_style_bg_color(lv.color_hex(0x000000), 0)

slider = lv.slider(scrn)
slider.set_size(300, 25)
slider.center()

import task_handler
# the duration needs to be set to 5 to have a good response from the mouse.
# There is a thread that runs that facilitates double buffering. 
th = task_handler.TaskHandler(duration=5)
```

The touch screen drivers will handle the rotation that you set to the display.
There is a single caviat to this. You MUST set up and initilize the display then 
create the touch drivers and after that has been done you can set the rotation.
The touch driver must exist prior to the display rotation being set.

For the ESP32 SOC's there is NVRAM that is available to store data in. That 
data is persistant between restarts of the ESP32. This feature is pur to use to 
store calibration data for the touch screen. In the exmaple below it shows how 
to properly create a display driver and touch driver and how to set the rotation 
and also the calibration storage.

You are able to force the calibration at any time by calling `indev.calibrate()` 
regardless of what `indev.is_calibrate` returns. This makes it possible to redo 
the calibration by either using a pin that you can check the state of or through
a button in your UI that you provide to the user.

Thank again and enjoy!!

***NOTE***: On ESP32-S3, SPI host 0 and SPI host 1 share a common SPI bus. 
The main Flash and PSRAM are connected to the host 0. It is recommended to use 
SPI host 2 when connecting an SPI device like a display that is going to utilize
the PSRAM for the frame buffer.


Bit orders are a tuple of durations. The first 2 numbers define a bit as 0 and the second 2 define a bit as 1. Negitive numbers are the duration to hold low and positive are for how long to hold high
"Res" or "Reset" is sent at the end of the data.
