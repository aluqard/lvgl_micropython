class ST7796(display_driver_framework.DisplayDriver):
    # The st7795 display controller has an internal framebuffer
    # arranged in 320 x 480
    # configuration. Physical displays with pixel sizes less than
    # 320 x 480 must supply a start_x and
    # start_y argument to indicate where the physical display begins
    # relative to the start of the
    # display controllers internal framebuffer.

    # this display driver supports RGB565 and also RGB666. RGB666 is going to
    # use twice as much memory as the RGB565. It is also going to slow down the
    # frame rate by 1/3, This is becasue of the extra byte of data that needs
    # to get sent. To use RGB666 the color depth MUST be set to 32.
    # so when compiling
    # make sure to have LV_COLOR_DEPTH=32 set in LVFLAGS when you call make.
    # For RGB565 you need to have LV_COLOR_DEPTH=16

    # the reason why we use a 32 bit color depth is because of how the data gets
    # written. The entire 8 bits for each byte gets sent. The controller simply
    # ignores the lowest 2 bits in the byte to make it a 6 bit color channel
    # We just have to tell lvgl that we want to use
